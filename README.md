I needed an easy way to know which NHL game I should be watching. The ticker gives me all the info I need in order to switch to games that are close in score, nail biters, and heading into OT.

No longer do I need to keep checking my devices for the scores, I simply pop open this ticker. Ideally you have a dedicated screen for this adjacent to your other screens.

To use, open the `nhl.html` file and set your browser to fullscreen mode (for which this was designed).

Scores update every 20 seconds.

Highlighting added to the time column when games are <5 minutes remaining and the score is within 1 OR if the game is in OT/shootout.
